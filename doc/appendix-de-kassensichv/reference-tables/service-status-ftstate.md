| `0x4445000000000002` | TSE device communication broken<br />The security mechanism was not able to communicate with the TSE device for at least one cycle. If this is the case no more communication trials are done to avoid long waiting times for each ReceiptRequest/ReceiptResponse sequence. To leave this state throw a Zero-Receipt, which forces a communication retry towards the TSE device.<br /> Receipts created in a state where no communication is possible with the TSE device are protected by the security mechanism of fiskaltrust. | 1.0                 |
