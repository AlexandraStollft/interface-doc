# Service Status: ftState

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For Montenegro (ME) this is `0x4d45`, which results in `0x4d45000000000000` as the value for the "ready" status.

The table below describes its supported statuses for the ftState field following Montenegrin law. These codes can be added through the logic operator `OR`<span id="t-service-status-ftstate-22">.</span>
